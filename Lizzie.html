            <h1>More About her</h1>
            <p>As a child, Olsen received ballet and singing lessons. She began acting at age 4, and by 11 she'd had
                small roles in How the West Was Fun and the straight-to-video series The Adventures of Mary-Kate &
                Ashley. Having appeared in her sisters' videos, when she was in the fourth grade, Olsen began to go on
                auditions for other projects, auditioning for the film Spy Kids. She almost quit acting in 2004 over the
                media frenzy surrounding Mary-Kate's eating disorder.</p>
            <p>She attended Campbell Hall School in North Hollywood, California from kindergarten through grade 12.
                After graduation, she enrolled at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. In 2009, Olsen spent a
                semester studying in Moscow, Russia at the Moscow Art Theatre School through the MATS program at the
                Eugene O'Neill Theater Center.</p>
            <p>Olsen's breakout role came in 2011, when she appeared in the film Martha Marcy May Marlene. The film,
                along with Olsen's performance, received critical acclaim. Olsen was nominated for and won numerous
                critics awards for her portrayal of the titular character Martha, a girl suffering from delusions and
                paranoia after fleeing her life in a cult and returning to her family. She next appeared in the horror
                film remake Silent House, in which she played the role of Sarah. The film received mixed reviews,
                although Olsen's performance was once again praised. Olsen also appeared in the music video "The Queen"
                by Carlotta. Olsen filmed the movie Red Lights during mid-2011, and it was released in the U.S. on July
                13, 2012. She starred in Josh Radnor's film Liberal Arts, which was released on January 22, 2012. She
                and Dakota Fanning starred in Very Good Girls, a 2013 release.</p>

            <h1>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h1>
            <p>Olsen starred in the 2015 superhero film Avengers: Age of Ultron, a sequel to The Avengers, joining the
                Marvel Cinematic Universe media franchise. In the film, she portrayed Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch,
                which marked the comic book character's film debut. She first appeared as the character in a
                post-credits scene of the 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson,
                who portrayed Maximoff's brother, Pietro. Olsen played the part with an accent originating from a
                fictional country called Sokovia, which she described as similar to Slovakian. She reprised the role in
                Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the last
                of which became the second highest-grossing film of all time. With the role, Olsen rose to fame.</p>
            <p>Alongside Paul Bettany as Vision, Olsen played Maximoff again in the superhero miniseries WandaVision,
                which premiered on Disney+ in January 2021. In addition to complimenting Olsen and Bettany's chemistry,
                critics praised the cast, with Vox's Alex Abad-Santos writing Olsen was brilliant in her portrayal and
                Linda Holmes of NPR highlighting her "indelible central performance" in their respective reviews. Olsen
                earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series
                or Movie and Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress Miniseries or Television Film for her
                performance. She reprised the role in the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which was
                released in May 2022 to mixed reviews. Olsen's performance received praise, with Owen Gleiberman of
                Variety writing that it "generates an operatic fire".</p>

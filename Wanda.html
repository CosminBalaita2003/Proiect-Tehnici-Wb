            <h1>Who is Wanda?</h1>
            <p>Wanda Maximoff is a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro.</p>
            <p>Born with the latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark
                and rallied anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an
                effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments
                with the Scepter under the supervision of Baron Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening and amplifying
                Wanda's powers. While her brother developed super-speed, she attained various psionic abilities. When
                HYDRA fell, the twins joined Ultron to get their revenge on Stark, but abandoned him when they
                discovered his true intentions to eradicate humanity. Wanda and Pietro joined the Avengers during the
                Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro was killed during the battle but Wanda survived, and shortly
                after relocated to the Avengers Compound in the United States of America.</p>

            <h1>A love for Sitcoms?</h1>
            <p><em>"So, what I see here is a baby witch obsessed with sitcoms and years of therapy ahead of her.."
                    ―Agatha Harkness to Wanda Maximoff</em></p>
            <p>SWanda Maximoff was born in 1989 to Oleg and Iryna Maximoff in Sokovia along with her twin brother,
                Pietro. Unknown to any of them, Maximoff was born with the latent power of Chaos Magic; making her the
                legendary Scarlet Witch. But her powers was too weak and was doomed only to diminish overtime. Growing
                up, her family would watch American by-products; such as television series and sitcoms to practice their
                English. Maximoff became incredibly fond of the sitcoms, in particular, The Dick Van Dyke Show, enjoying
                and desiring the idyllic lives they depicted</p>
            <p>At the age of ten, during all of the ongoing bombings in Sokovia, when her father, Oleg got home,
                Maximoff chose for her family to watch The Dick Van Dyke Show for TV night, as it was her favorite.
                Suddenly, a mortar shell hit their apartment building, instantly killing both of Maximoff's parents,
                Iryna and Oleg.</p>

            <h1>Wandavision</h1>
            <p>Maximoff, overcome by severe anguish, fell to her knees and had a breakdown, causing her to unknowingly
                unleash her Chaos Magic for the first time, forming a new reality around her, transforming the entire
                town of Westview and depicting it as a 1950s sitcom. Maximoff was also able to conjure a house to live
                in, and finished by creating a new Vision. Upon casting her spell, she engulfed herself in her new
                reality, where she and Vision would go on to live happily together</p>
            <p>As Maximoff reclaimed her magic from Harkness, she transformed into the Scarlet Witch. This frightened
                Harkness, who said she didn't know what she had unleashed, and Maximoff removed the dark storm clouds
                allowing the sunshine to reappear.</p>

            <p>"The Darkhold only showed me the truth. Everything I lost can be mine again."</p>
            <p>    ―Stephen Strange and Scarlet Witch.</p>
            <p>Maximoff decided to seclude herself, and moved into a cabin in an unknown location, where she learned more about herself, and the power she possessed. Becoming more confident in her abilities, Maximoff learned about the Astral Dimension and was able to coexist in two forms. Her physical form performing menial tasks like brewing a cup of tea while her astral form reading the Darkhold to learn and understand her power. One day while reading the Darkhold, she heard what seemed to be the cries of her children calling for help</p>
